I think I lost my commits while doing a --force yesterday. Don't know what to do to recover

About
I built a full-stack application using Node.js, Mongoose, Express, and Angular2. This app is for anyone who wants to create a new account or login. After that you can add as many activities as you would like. You can add a title, img, location and description of activity. 

Deployed through Heroku

JWT- Used to create a login page in which you create a name and a password. The password is encrypted so hackers cannot retrieve personal information. Also used to log user out.

Users- Used to login to your account if you created one.

I used Node.js, Mongoose, Express and Angular2.

Future Upgrades - I would like to get the functionality 100%. As if right now the entire backend is working, but for some reason the id is not being tracked on the front end. So the update delete and show route are not working on the actual page. Also need to fix heroku deployment.
